# any Host header outside a small built-in allowlist (localhost, IP literals, etc.) with a bare 403
# "Host not permitted" -- the identical issue already documented and fixed the same way in this repo's
# ../../external/outie.rb (see its own comment for the full history: `set :protection, except:` has
# proven unreliable across versions here). This facade is meant to be reached under its own real
# hostname (SHALLOT_FACADE_BASE_URL), not just localhost, and -- like outie.rb -- never renders
# browser-served HTML or trusts the Host header for anything security-sensitive, so disabling this
# specific check costs nothing real here.
