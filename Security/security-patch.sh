# Both images patched by this script are ours (built from source in this repo -- shallot-facade/,
# beacon-facade/), so each one gets built fresh from source first -- not just OS-patched on top of a
# stale previous build -- so any Dockerfile-level fix (a dependency bump, a hardening change) actually
# reaches the patched image, not only the OS package layer. The OS layer is then patched on top of that
# fresh build (shell in, apk update+upgrade, commit) rather than baked into the Dockerfile itself, since
# re-running this script regularly is what actually keeps the OS layer current -- a Dockerfile-baked
# dist-upgrade would only be as fresh as whenever the Dockerfile itself was last built.
#
# Both images share one base OS family (ruby:3.2-alpine, i.e. apk) -- unlike Severance's own
# security-patch.sh, which also patches two apt-based images, so this script never needed the
# apt/apk branch that one has. The image's own build-arg name for its baked-in VERSION label isn't
# shared (SHALLOT_FACADE_VERSION vs BEACON_FACADE_VERSION -- each facade's own convention, kept as-is
# rather than forced into a shared name).
#
# After the OS-level patch, if the image has a Gemfile, attempts an automated Ruby gem CVE patch
# (auto_patch_ruby_gems.rb) against this run's own fresh scan -- see that script for the three
# strategies (bundle update within an existing constraint for a real dependency; widen the constraint
# itself, flagged for review, when that's the only way to reach a fix; exact-pin + Dockerfile uninstall
# attempt for a phantom default gem). If it makes changes: rebuilds, runs the project's own test command
# (shallot-facade has an rspec suite; beacon-facade doesn't, so its boot smoke test is its only gate)
# plus a boot smoke test, and only keeps the change if both pass -- otherwise reverts and falls back to
# the pre-autopatch build. A successful, verified change is queued (not committed here) for a PR at the
# very end of the run -- this script never merges a gem-CVE change into a default branch on its own,
# only opens a PR for a human to review (a widened-constraint fix gets its PR title/body flagged even
# more explicitly -- see patch_image()/open_autopatch_pr() below).
#
# Every scan (pre- and, if applicable, post-autopatch) is also annotated by annotate_gem_shadowing.rb:
# whether a flagged gemspec finding is a stale on-disk copy `bundle exec` never actually loads, vs a
# real, still-reachable one.
#
# All progress output below goes to stderr; the final `fairdatasystems/
